### Deriving precipitation from geopotential height

Precipitation is the result of a combination of physical and chemical processes happening in the atmosphere. The amount of rain cannot be directly computed by global numerical models because this process operates at temporal and spatial scales that are much smaller than the models' operating resolution. Instead, precipitation is estimated by NWP models using coarse approximations of these processes, which are referred as parameterisations. Parametrisations constitute a complex component of NWP models and normally require to be fine tuned so non-resolved physical processes are well represented across different areas and atmospheric situations.

Data-driven methods, using convolutional neural networks, have demonstrated to provide a simple and effective alternative to these parameterisation modules [[1]](#1).

This animation compares the outputs of the NWP precipitation field (bottom) which is one of the parameterised variables, with the output of a convolutional neural network (top-right) trained to reproduce precipitation using geopotential height (left) as its only input. The animation represents the area over Europe and spans over 20 years worth of data.

Although precipitation is calculated using more significantly more inputs in the original parameterisation, such as water content, solar radiation, dust particles and their evolution through time, the data-driven approach is surprisingly close to the original.


### Filtering and compressing timeseries of multispectral satellite images

Satellite images provide valuable information about the surface of the Earth. However, interpreting the images is not easy. Nearly 70% of our planet is covered by clouds at any given points. This means that most images available need to be filtered and calibrated to remove other atmospheric effects before the Earth's surface can be studied. Changes happening in the surface typically happen at lower temporal scales than those in the atmosphere, suggesting that land dynamics can be accurately described using a lower-dimensional space than the original data. Under this premise, we can use machine learning to calculate low-rank approximations of timeseries of the original satellite images to remove the effects of clouds and shadows [[2]](#2).

This video shows a time lapse of Sentinel-2 images over a farming area in New South Wales (Australia). On the left, the raw images, as they are received from the satellite. On the right, the result of the low-rank decomposition using machine learning to clean the images from noise coming from clouds and shadows. This algorithm is able to to capture the variance coming from the land surface and remove other atmospheric effects.
